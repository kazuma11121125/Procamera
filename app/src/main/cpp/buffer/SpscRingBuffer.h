// Single-Producer Single-Consumer lock-free ring buffer of trivially-copyable elements.
//
// Producer (push) is called from the Oboe audio callback thread and MUST stay wait-free:
// no malloc/new/delete, no locks, no syscalls, bounded execution time (see §4.2's Audio
// Callback prohibitions). This class satisfies that by allocating its backing storage once
// in the constructor (called from a non-RT thread when the engine starts) and never
// resizing; push()/pop() only touch already-owned memory and atomics.
//
// Consumer (pop) is called from the dedicated Audio Encoder thread (not RT-constrained,
// but kept lock-free anyway since SPSC makes it free).
//
// -- False-sharing rationale --
// writeIndex_ is written only by the producer and read by the consumer; readIndex_ is
// written only by the consumer and read by the producer. If both atomics shared a single
// 64-byte cache line, every producer write would invalidate the consumer's cached copy of
// that line (and vice versa) even though the two threads never touch each other's field —
// pure MESI ping-pong with no logical need for it. On a mobile SoC this shows up as extra
// cache-coherency latency injected right into the audio callback's tight deadline. Padding
// each atomic to its own cache line (alignas(kCacheLineSize)) removes that false sharing.
//
// -- Memory ordering rationale --
// Producer, after copying new elements into the backing array, publishes the new
// writeIndex_ with memory_order_release. Consumer reads writeIndex_ with
// memory_order_acquire before reading the corresponding array slots. Per the C++ memory
// model, this release/acquire pair guarantees the consumer observes the producer's array
// writes that happened-before the release store — without it, the consumer could read
// stale/torn data despite seeing the updated index. The symmetric relationship holds for
// readIndex_ (consumer publishes with release; producer acquires it to know which slots
// are free to overwrite). This is intentionally NOT relaxed+cached: push()/pop() operate on
// whole audio-callback bursts (tens to hundreds of frames), not per-sample, so the
// acquire/release cost is amortized and not worth the added complexity of a
// locally-cached, periodically-refreshed opposite index.
