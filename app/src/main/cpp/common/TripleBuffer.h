// Wait-free single-writer/single-reader triple buffer for exchanging small POD state
// (e.g. EQ coefficients) between the UI/coroutine thread (writer) and the audio callback
// thread (reader) without locks, retries, or allocation.
//
// Why not a plain 2-slot "double buffer" with an atomic active-index?
// A naive double buffer (writer fills the inactive slot, then flips an atomic index) has
// a real write-tearing hazard here: if the writer publishes two updates back-to-back
// faster than the reader's next callback observes the first one, the writer's second
// update can start overwriting the exact slot the reader is still mid-read of, because a
// 2-slot scheme has no way to know "has the reader definitely moved off this slot yet".
// UI gesture callbacks (a fast slider drag) can plausibly fire faster than the audio
// callback's few-millisecond cadence, especially under scheduling jitter, so this isn't
// just a theoretical concern for §4.2's coefficient hand-off.
//
// The triple buffer removes the hazard structurally: the writer always writes into a slot
// that is neither the one currently exposed to the reader nor the one most recently
// handed off — there are always 3 slots for at most 2 "in flight" roles (writer-owned,
// reader-owned) plus one "unclaimed" spare, so the writer can never touch a slot the
// reader might still be reading. Both sides are wait-free: no CAS-retry loops, no
// possibility of the reader blocking on the writer.
