// output stream (headphone monitor passthrough, §4.2). The input stream's audio callback
// is the sole RT thread in this class: onAudioReady() runs the DSP chain (input gain ->
// high-pass filter -> EQ -> makeup gain -> safety limiter -> meter) and pushes the result into a lock-free ring buffer that
// the (non-RT) Audio Encoder thread drains from Kotlin. Every method other than onAudioReady() /
// onErrorAfterClose() runs on a non-RT caller (UI/coroutine thread via JNI) and may take
// locks / allocate freely; onAudioReady() itself touches nothing but already-owned
// objects and their RT-safe methods.
