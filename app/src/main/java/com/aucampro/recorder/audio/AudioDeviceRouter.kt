/**

 * §4.2's priority: USB Audio > 有線 Headset Mic > 内蔵 Mic. Every method here runs on a
 * normal JVM thread — like [NativeEngineBridge] itself, nothing here touches the audio
 * callback thread.
 *
 * This class only *selects and observes* devices; it does not open/close streams. The
 * caller ([com.procamera.recorder.pipeline.RecordingPipeline]) owns that, and must be the
 * one to fall back through [candidateInputDevices] in order — the native layer
 * (`OboeFullDuplexEngine::openInputStreamLocked`) only retries SharingMode/InputPreset
 * combinations on a *single* deviceId, it never tries a different device. Without that
 * fallback, a USB interface that happens to open as mono or at an unsupported rate would
 * fail `start()`/`reopenInputStream()` outright — regressing a device where the built-in
 * mic previously worked, which is the one outcome this feature must never cause.
