/**
 * Owns the real `CameraDevice`/`CameraCaptureSession` lifecycle (§4.1).
 *
 * **Phase 4 additions** (UI wiring):
 * - [startRepeating] now accepts `List<Surface>` so a preview surface can be included
 *   alongside the encoder's InputSurface. Session is created with all provided surfaces in
 *   one call; Camera2 requires a new session when the surface set changes, so switching
 *   from preview-only → preview+encoder closes and recreates the session.
 * - [updateCaptureParams] modifies the repeating request in-place (no session restart
 *   needed — `setRepeatingRequest` replaces the previous one atomically at the HAL level).
 *   This is how ISO/shutter/WB/focus changes become live-visible in the viewfinder.
 * - [captureResultListener] seam lets [FocusController] observe AF state transitions
 *   from each CaptureResult without coupling it to this class directly.

     * had a stale frame from the last "repeating" delivery sitting in it before the actual
     * one-shot capture's image even arrived) — a large, pointless continuous encode cost
     * `LuminanceHistogramReader` deliberately *does* want (it needs every preview frame,
