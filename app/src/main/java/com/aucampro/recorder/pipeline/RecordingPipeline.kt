/**
 * Unified camera/audio/encode/mux pipeline for Phase 4's full UI build.
 *
 * **State machine**: IDLE → PREVIEWING ↔ RECORDING → IDLE
 *
 * - [startPreview]: Opens the camera, streams to a [Surface] (viewfinder). No encoders run.
 * - [startRecording]: Reconfigures the session to include the encoder's InputSurface alongside
 *   the preview, then starts the full encode/mux pipeline. Must be in PREVIEWING state.
 * - [stopRecording]: Drains and finalises all encoders/muxers, then restarts preview automatically.
 * - [stopAll]: Tears everything down unconditionally (call from ViewModel.onCleared).
 *
 * **Parameter updates**: [updateCameraParams] applies changes (ISO, shutter, focus, WB) to the
 * live repeating request without reopening the session.
 *
 * **Metric access**: [nativeEngine] is exposed as a `val` so the ViewModel can poll
 * [NativeEngineBridge.peakDb] / [NativeEngineBridge.rmsDb] / [NativeEngineBridge.hardwareXRunCount]
 * at 60 fps without any extra plumbing through this class.
 *
 * スモークテストマイルストーン（docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §Phase4）で動作確認済みのパイプラインを
 * ベースにし、UI / Foreground Serviceが扱える本格的な状態機械に拡張した。

     * mid-recording) or output (e.g. monitoring headphones unplugged) — or the user
     * changes the mic picker in Settings. Handles two independent concerns off that one
     * signal, since [AudioDeviceRouter.register] only allows a single callback:
     *
     * 1. **Input routing**: no-op if the audio engine isn't running yet, or if the

     *    device was plugged in while USB is already active). Falls back through the
     *    remaining candidates on failure, same reasoning as [ensureAudioEngineStarted].
     *
     *    Native reopenInputStream() measures its own close/open gap and inserts silence
     *    before starting the replacement callback. Keeping that write native-side avoids
     *    racing a Kotlin silence producer against the new Oboe callback producer.
     *
     * 2. **Monitoring safety**: if monitoring is currently on and the headphone-type
     *    output that made it safe to enable (see [setMonitoringEnabled]'s doc) just
     *    disappeared, force it off rather than letting it silently fall back to the
     *    built-in speaker and feed back into the mic.
     *
     * Caller must already hold [sessionMutex] (see [dispatchAudioDeviceSetChanged]). The
     * blocking native calls run inside [withContext]\(Dispatchers.IO\) — same reasoning as
     * [stopRecordingInternalLockedAsync]'s doc: this used to run every native call
     * (including [NativeEngineBridge.reopenInputStream], which was already known to be slow
     * enough to ANR the main thread once before — see [AudioDeviceRouter.register]'s doc) synchronously on
     * whatever thread called it, which for [setPreferredInputKind] is main.

     * here by preview attach/detach instead of the initial preview→recording transition.
     * Uses [CameraSessionController.reconfigureSession] rather than [CameraSessionController.stop]
     * + `startRepeating` specifically because this can fire *mid-recording* — closing and
     * reopening the `CameraDevice` here would be far more disruptive to an already-running

     * Caller must already hold [sessionMutex] (not reentrant — do not call this from
     * inside another `sessionMutex.withLock` block).

     * Best-effort: recording is *not* aborted on failure here (e.g. a camera HAL
     * rejecting the resulting surface combination). A failure means the viewfinder may
     * not resume/detach cleanly, but the encoders keep running regardless — they don't
     * know or care whether the session reconfiguration succeeded, only whether frames
     * keep arriving at their InputSurface. If the HAL failure means frames *stop*
     * arriving, that surfaces as a silent stall rather than a reported error — there is
     * no `onEvent` channel threaded through preview attach/detach today. Full
     * crash/stall recovery is out of scope here (§Phase4b, not yet built).
