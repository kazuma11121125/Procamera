     * device: a recording started ~87s into preview lost effectively all of its audio
     * (0.064s out of a 30s take) — [cumulativeSampleCount] started at 0 while the anchor
     * below correctly points at the *stream's* true frame 0 (up to 87s earlier), so every
     * PTS this encoder computed landed far in the past relative to recordingStartNanos and
     * was silently dropped by [PtsClockDomain.normalizeAudioPtsUs]'s monotonic guard until
     * enough frames drained to close that gap — which for a short recording never happens.
     *
     * Fixed by (1) flushing the stale backlog so draining starts from "now", and (2)
     * seeding [cumulativeSampleCount] from the correlation's own frame position instead of
     * 0, so it lines up with the same frame-0 the anchor below is computed against.
